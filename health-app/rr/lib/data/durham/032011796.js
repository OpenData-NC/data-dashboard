A COPY OF FORM 1 B  EMPLOYEE HEALTH POLICY  WAS LEFT WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT AT THE TIME OF THE INSPECTION.  THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THE FORM WAS LEFT.  MY SUGGESTION WOULD BE TO POST THIS IN AN AREA THAT CAN BE REFERRED TO AS NEEDED.  DURING;5 205.11 USING A HANDWASHING SINK OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE   PF  THERE SHOULD BE NO STORAGE IN THE HANDWASH SINK.  AT THE START OF THE INSPECTION THERE WAS A DIRTY POT BEING STORED IN THE HANDWASH SINK.
